Privacy
Privacy information is captured as follows:

"privacy": {
  "piiData": {
    "uses": [ "storage" ],
    "storageLocation": ["AUS"],
    "sourceLocation": ["AUS"]
  }
}
Note that valid uses include:

none: PII data is not handled at all by this system.
storage: the system stores PII data at rest. An attacker with access to this system or its backups may have access to all PII records stored.
process: the system handles PII data obtained from another system transiently. An attacker with access to the running system might be able to intercept only those PII records being processed.
collect: the system is a collection point of PII data. This use case can be considered a sub-set of process in terms of what an attacker could do.
Note that locations must be valid Alpha-3 ISO 3166 country codes (http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes).

If a system stores PII data it is mandatory to specify the storageLocation entry.

If a system only process PII data, storeLocation and sourceLocation should not be specified in the document.
