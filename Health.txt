Health
Note these definitions:

green (circle) - meets expectations (ABC)
yellow (triangle) - partial meet for expectations
red (cross) - does not meet expectations
Health records must be ordered from most recent to oldest.

Additionally, quarterly rating 'overall' and 'score' fields are injected during the packaging phase of the build.

These do not persist in the sources, but are regenerated for each build, any values added for 'overall' and 'score' attributes of the quarterly health rating will be overridden in the published data.
